 "Long ago, the barrier between men and monsters collapsed.",
    "The wall between worlds was no more.",
    "But the war never left their minds — memories of hatred ran rampant.",
    "Humans and monsters clashed, red flooding the earth.",
    "Light and dark collided, birthing a fear that clouded every eye.",
    "Love was eclipsed by hate. Light, eclipsed by shadow. Peace, eclipsed by violence.",
    "The stars fled in terror from the midnight below.",
    "The sun hid its face behind the moon.",
    "Warmth became but a memory.",
    "And both men and monsters wondered...",
    "Would the light ever shine upon the broken earth again?"
A surreal journey through light, darkness, and the fragile hope in between.
Long ago, the barrier was broken. Monsters and humans once again saw the light of day. But peace was fleeting. The world cracked in two—light on one side, darkness on the other.
You are a child born between light and dark. Guided by memory, mystery, and grief, you must journey through forgotten lands, symbolic trials, and the remnants of a world undone. With your companion Sorrel, your mission is clear: restore balance... before shadow consumes everything.
A game inspired by UNDERTALE.
SOLUNE combines heartfelt storytelling, pixel art, and surreal imagery to tell a story of hope, loss, and the strength to rise. Choices matter.
Symbolic, atmospheric cutscenes
Puzzle-filled dungeons of light and darkness
Dynamic characters shaped by grief, joy, and fate
A haunting, emotional original soundtrack
Multiple paths. Multiple endings. One fragile world.
This is not just another tale of war and peace. This is the story of the space between.
Notice: This is a fan made sequel to the hit RPG "UNDERTALE" (made by Toby Fox). This contains some spoilers for this game. It is recommended that you play that first. Download it here: undertale.com
